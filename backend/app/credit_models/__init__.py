# This file is intentionally empty to avoid import conflicts.
# Models should be imported directly from their respective files:
# - Base models: from app.models import User, Transaction, etc. (refers to models.py) 
# - Credit deployment models: from app.credit_models.credit_deployment import CreditOffer, etc.

# If you need to import base models, use:
# import sys, os
# sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)))
# from models import User, Transaction, EmotionalEvent
